# Prosper Loan Data Exploration
## by: Abed Ibrahim Sultan


## Dataset

> This document explores a dataset containing 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan. This [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0) explains the variables in the data set. Only 12 attributes were selected to do the analysis on.

## Summary of Findings

> There is no one specific feature of intersest in the dataset. Instead, I investigated different features with no major one, and I answered some questions which are:
1- What is the distribution of each attribute?
2- What is the relation between the borrower rate and the loan original amount?
3- How are the stated monthly income and the loan current days delinquent attributes related?
4- What is the distribution of each loan status in each income range?
5- What is the relation between the borrower rate and the term?
6- What is the relation between the income range and the monthly loan payment?
7- What is the relation between the loan original amount, stated monthly income and borrower rate?
8- What is the relation between the borrower rate, monthly loan payment, and Term?
But, We can assume that the most interesting features are borrower rate.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For, Borrower Rate by Term and Monthly loan payment.
This Visualization is using the faceting method for a scatter plot to describe the relationship between borrower rate and monthly loan payment by term. For the term 12, the borrower rates are fewer than 0.3 with the higher monthly loan payment being about 2500. For the term 36, the borrower rates are fewer than 0.5 with the higher monthly loan payment being fewer than 1500. For the term 60, the borrower rates are fewer than 0.35 with the higher monthly loan payment being about 1000
